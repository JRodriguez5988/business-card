                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have always been fascinated by how things work and the tech industry also interests me so I decided to put the two together and become a software developer. I have plenty of experience working in and leading teams so I am definitely ok with breaking up the workload and collaborating with others.
                </p>
                <p>I finished highschool in 2006 and then went on to enlist in the Air Force. My time there was very formative and I took my lessons learned into my next endeavor as a manager at my hometown McDonald's. I have progressed all the way up to General Manager and I also work as the Organization Technology Person (OTP Pro).</p>
                <p>I plan to use all I've learned in life to make the jump into the tech industry along with the help of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>.</p>
